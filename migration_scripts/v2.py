This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. Rewording the migration handling comment to match the tone and style of the gold code, making it more straightforward.
2. Ensuring the import statements are in the same order and format as in the gold code, including the specific modules being imported.
3. Applying best practices as indicated in the gold code, ensuring any recommended practices are included.
4. Using a more concise unpacking method to fetch the database version, aligning with the gold code for better readability and consistency.
5. Ensuring the SQL commands are formatted consistently with the gold code in terms of spacing and indentation for better readability.
6. Modifying the success message to match the phrasing used in the gold code for consistency.
