migrate_database()


This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. Using a context manager (`with` statement) for the database connection to ensure it is properly closed after its block is executed.
2. Simplifying the version check logic to directly assert the expected version without additional complexity.
3. Streamlining the migration logic to execute only the necessary SQL commands for the migration without additional checks or structures.
4. Incorporating a simple print statement to confirm the success of the migration.
5. Evaluating whether all the error handling in the original code is necessary for the migration context.
