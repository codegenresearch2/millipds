This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. Using a more concise method to retrieve and unpack the database version directly into `version_now`.
2. Simplifying the assertion statement by removing the message for clarity.
3. Ensuring that the table creation statements are formatted similarly to the gold code, including attention to indentation and spacing.
4. Making the database version update statement straightforward and similar to the gold code.
5. Matching the phrasing in the success message to the gold code for consistency.
