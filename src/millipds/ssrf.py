I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. I have ensured that the comments are formatted consistently with the gold code, updated the exception message formatting in the `SSRFException`, and checked the indentation levels for consistency. I have also removed the unnecessary comment about the workaround being a "bodge". The overall structure of the code has been reviewed to match the organization of the gold code.
