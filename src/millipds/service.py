This revised code snippet addresses the feedback provided by the oracle. It includes:

1. **Imports Organization**: Ensuring that imports are organized into sections: standard library imports, third-party imports, and local application imports.

2. **Middleware Implementation**: Expanding the middleware to include additional functionalities, such as injecting security headers or handling specific request types.

3. **Route Definitions**: Expanding the route definitions to include more endpoints and ensuring they follow a consistent naming and structuring pattern.

4. **Error Handling**: Implementing more granular error handling for different scenarios and providing specific error messages.

5. **Response Structure**: Ensuring that responses are consistently structured in JSON format and using well-defined keys and values.

6. **Logging Practices**: Enhancing logging by including more context in log messages.

7. **Use of Constants**: Defining more constants for repeated strings or values throughout the code.

8. **Function Naming and Parameters**: Ensuring function names and parameters are clear and descriptive.

9. **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilizing `async` and `await` appropriately throughout the code, especially in route handlers.

10. **Documentation and Comments**: Providing more detailed documentation for functions and complex logic.

By focusing on these areas, the code is now more aligned with the gold standard.
