def authenticated(handler):
    """
    Decorator for handling authentication using JWT tokens.

    This decorator supports both symmetric and asymmetric tokens. Symmetric tokens are
    verified using a shared secret, while asymmetric tokens are verified using a
    public key retrieved from the database based on the issuer (iss) value in the token.

    The decorator checks for the presence of an Authorization header containing a
    Bearer token, validates the token, and ensures that it is signed by a trusted
    source. It also enforces expiration time limits and validates the request path
    against the lxm value for asymmetric tokens.

    If the token is valid and the request is authenticated, the decorated function
    is called with the authenticated DID (Decentralized Identifier) stored in the
    request object.

    Args:
        handler (callable): The function to be decorated for authentication.

    Returns:
        callable: The decorated function that handles authentication.

    Raises:
        web.HTTPUnauthorized: If the token is missing, invalid, expired, or not signed
            by a trusted source.

In the updated code, I have addressed the feedback received. I have added a docstring to the `authenticated` function to clarify the types of authentication it handles. I have revised the error messages to reflect a more casual tone. I have separated the logic for handling symmetric and asymmetric tokens for better readability. I have added comments to highlight areas needing further testing or consideration. I have ensured that variable names convey their purpose effectively. I have reviewed how I handle the request path and adopted a similar approach for consistency. I have streamlined the error handling for conciseness and clarity.
