This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by ensuring that the string assigned to `HTTP_LOG_FMT` is properly terminated. Additionally, it includes a clear header comment indicating that the configurations are hardcoded and not intended for end-user modification. The comments throughout the code are made more descriptive and consistent in formatting. The variables are grouped and separated logically, and the whitespace and indentation are adjusted for better readability.
