This updated code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. Ensuring that the `HTTP_LOG_FMT` string is properly terminated with a closing quotation mark.
2. Formatting comments consistently with the gold code.
3. Ensuring proper spacing and indentation throughout the code.
4. Maintaining the order of constants as specified in the gold code.
