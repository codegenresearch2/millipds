In the updated code, I have addressed the test case feedback by removing the invalid syntax from the `static_config.py` file. I have also added comments to explain the purpose of the version constants and included the `PLC_DIRECTORY_HOST` constant as suggested by the oracle feedback. I have ensured that the comments are consistent and formatted similarly to the gold code.
