I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. I have updated the comments to be more concise and consistent with the gold code. I have also added parentheses for the multi-line string `HTTP_LOG_FMT` for better readability. I have updated the value for `PLC_DIRECTORY_HOST` to include the protocol. I have also added a comment about firehose events to enhance understanding.
