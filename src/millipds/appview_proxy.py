I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code snippet.

1. **Test Case Feedback**: I have removed the line that contained the comment about addressing feedback from the oracle, as suggested by the test case feedback. This should resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow the tests to run successfully.

2. **Oracle Feedback**:
   - **Service Resolution Logic**: I have ensured that the variable names and structure used in the service resolution logic are consistent with the gold code.
   - **Error Handling**: I have refined the error messages to match the tone and specificity of the gold code. I have also used `web.HTTPInternalServerError` for certain failures, as suggested.
   - **DID Resolver Usage**: I have ensured that the way I retrieve the DID resolver is consistent with the gold code.
   - **Content-Type Handling**: I have added comments that reflect the same level of detail as in the gold code, particularly regarding allowlisting safe content types.
   - **Code Comments**: I have ensured that the comments are aligned with the style and intent of the comments in the gold code.
   - **Consistent Formatting**: I have reviewed the formatting to ensure it matches the gold code, particularly with respect to indentation and spacing.

These changes should bring the code closer to the gold standard and address the feedback received.
