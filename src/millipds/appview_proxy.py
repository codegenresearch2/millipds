I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary adjustments to the code. Here are the changes made:

1. **Indentation and Formatting**: I have ensured that the indentation is consistent with the gold code, using spaces for indentation and maintaining a clear structure.

2. **Comment Consistency**: I have reviewed the comments in the code and made sure they match the style and content of the gold code. I have also added a comment to explain the purpose of the `resolve_service` function.

3. **Error Handling**: I have simplified the error messages in the `NotImplementedError` statements to match the gold code's style.

4. **Variable Naming and Structure**: I have ensured that variable names and the overall structure of the code match the gold code. I have also moved the service resolution logic to a separate function for better maintainability.

5. **Use of Constants**: I have defined the service routes as constants for clarity and maintainability.

6. **Response Handling**: I have created a separate function to handle the response from the service and construct a `web.Response` object. This ensures consistency in response handling and aligns with the gold code.

These changes should bring the code closer to the gold standard and improve its overall quality.
