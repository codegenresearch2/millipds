In the rewritten code, I have added a new dependency for DID resolution and included a DID resolver instance. I have also updated the `__all__` list to include the new DID resolver and its corresponding getter function. The existing middleware and routes are maintained as per the user's preference. The CORS settings are kept unchanged.\n\nThe SQL statements are not modified in this snippet as the provided code does not contain any SQL statements. However, the user's preference for using parameterized queries should be followed when writing new SQL statements.

The user's preference for using DID resolution for service identification is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, but it can be implemented by using the DID resolver instance to resolve the service DID and obtain the service endpoint.
