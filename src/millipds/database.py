To address the feedback, I will ensure that the `database` module is correctly defined and accessible within the `millipds` package. This involves checking that the `database.py` file exists in the `millipds` directory and that it is properly structured to be recognized as a module. Additionally, I will verify that the `__init__.py` file in the `millipds` package includes an appropriate import statement for the `database` module, allowing it to be imported from the package. If the `database` module is not present, I will create it or ensure that it is correctly named and located."}
