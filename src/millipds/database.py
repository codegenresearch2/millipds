python\\n# Assuming the structure of the millipds package is as follows:\\\\n# millipds/\\\\n#   __init__.py\\\\n#   service.py\\\\n#   database.py\\\\n#   integration_test.py\\\\n\\n# In the __init__.py of the millipds package, ensure that the database module is included in the exports. This can be done by adding the following line:\\\\n\\nfrom .database import *\\\\n\\n# This will allow the service module to import the database module without issues. Additionally, ensure that the database module is correctly implemented and can be imported without errors.\\\\n\\n# In the service.py module, import the database module as follows:\\\\nfrom millipds import database\\\\n\\n# This should resolve the ImportError and allow the tests to pass.
