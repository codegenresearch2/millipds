To address the feedback, I will correct the content of the `database.py` file to contain valid Python code. This involves removing the current text and replacing it with appropriate code that defines the functionality intended for the `database` module. Ensuring that the file starts with valid Python syntax will resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow the tests to run successfully.
